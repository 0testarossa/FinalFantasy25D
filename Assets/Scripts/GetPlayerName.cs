"P4: Unexpected?",
"P4: I told you all before. They're after P2. Can you at least trust me after that? Is it that difficult to understand what's going on?",

"P2: You should be by my side P4...",
"P4: I am P2. But I care a lot about you. And that's why you should leave that town.", //105
"P2: No! Stay away from me!",

"P2: All of you. Just LEAVE me now!",

"P1: But it's...",
"P4: Calm down. We can just all talk about it and find a solution.",

"P2: Ah, I know one.", //115

"P3: Calm down my sweet princess. No one here wants bad for you.",
"P2: ...",
"P2: No comment.",
"P1: My father knows Infrids very well. When I was a child he was telling me a lot about them. Why not give it a try and ask him if he knows anything about their strange behavior?", //120
"P2: That sounds...",
"P4: Cool. Let's do it.",
"P3: Not a bad idea.",
"P2: If you think that I'll go with you, then you are completely wrong. I'll stay here and nothing will change my mind.",
"P4: No one is asking you about that.", //125
"P2: Cool.",
"P2: Then go and resolve the mystery meanwhile I will stay here with my favorite book.",
"P2: Good luck my big heroes.",

"P1: P4 what are you...", //130
"P4: Everything is fine. We can begin our little adventure.",

"P2: I believe in you.",
"P4: No need. I take you with me.", //135
"P2: Yes. You take me with...",
"P2: WHAT?!",
"P2: You clearly said before that I don't need to go with you.",
"P2: Don't even try to deny that.",
"P4: I won't, don't worry.", //140
"P4: Indeed, you don't need to go with us.",

"P2: No! Don't even come closer!", //145
"P2: No!",
"P2: Please!",
"P2: Someone help meeeeeeeeeeeeeee!",
"P2: Remind me please again why I even stay here with you.",
"P3: Because we all care about you and don't want anything bad to happen to you again.", //150
"P4: Because I don't care about your opinion anymore.",

"P2: You all see?",
"P2: He changes his mind more often than any girl that I know.",
"P1: Watch out!", //155
"P3: Not again them! ",
"Infrids: Give us the woman and we will not hurt you.",
"P1: Can we just talk? I don't want bloodshed.",
"Infrids: We're not stupid! We will not let you be possessed!",
"P1: Possessed? But wh...", //160
"Infrids: Die!",
"P1: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",
"P4: You will thank me later.",
"P1: If there will be any later...",
"P1: (Gulp)", //165
"P1: I don't get it.",
"P1: What do they mean by being possessed?",
"P2: I wouldn't even try to understand those disgusting reptile.",
"P2: Just look at me.",
"P2: I'm looking like a real disaster after that fight.", //170
"P2: I need to wash.",
"P2: And eat something.",
"P2: I'm hungry!",
"P4: And here we are. Your father's house P1.",
"P1: Yeah. I hope he's here.", //175
"P3: Is he a nicer person than Inffrids? I hope so...",
"P2: Hello? Are you listening to me?",
"P1: Yes.",
"P1: He is nice. And I love to talk with him whenever I have free time to visit him.",
"P4: Perfect. Now, all we need is to talk with him about the Ingrids and solve the problem as fast as possible.", //180
"P2: Where is the bathroom?",
"P2: Okey, don't mind me. I'll look for it for myself.",
"P1: But it's really strange. If I remember right, they were always in good relation with people in this town. I don't...",
"P2: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",
"P3: P2!", //185
"P1: P2!",
"P4: Does it really matter?",
"P3: ...",
"P1: ...",
"P4: All right. ", //190
"P4: Let's rescue this world's failure once more...",
"P2: Phew!",
"P2: Do they never heard about someone's privacy in the bathroom?",
"P3: They live in the forest...",
"P2: ...", //195
"P2: Good point.",
"P1: I'm afraid that the mystery of the mysterious behavior of them will stay as it is because my father isn't even here.",
"P4: No way...",
"P2: Can't be true...",
"P3: So we just need to take our time and wait. How about playing hide and seek?", //200
"P1: It is not as simple as you think it is. I found something important.",
"P4: Important?",
"P4: What is it?",
"P1: The letter that my father wrote to me...",
"P2: Is he greeting us as well?", //205
"P4: ...",
"P4: Just leave it to us.",
"P4: Go and wash, princess.",
"P2: Finally.",
"(drept P2)", //210
"P4: And returning to the right topic, does he mention anything about Infrids?",
"P1: I'm not sure. In the beginning, he is talking about his house and the mystery thing inside it.",
"P4: What is it?",
"P1: I don't know. He described it as something that I will know what is it.",
"P4: It doesn't help much.", //215
"P3: Agree",
"P1: Additionally there is something about saint staff. ",
"P4: Sounds again like the puzzle.",
"P3: And that puzzle is connected with our lady.",
"P1: What makes you say that?", //220
"P3: Oh, come on. Even child would connect those two facts.",
"P3: Our princess is a high priest and so she's using saint stuff like a staff. Does it sound familiar?",
"P1: I'm using staff as well. I don't get your point.",
"P3: But it's not a saint staff. You do not pray to god and not do some other stuff I don't understand at all.",
"P4: That's obvious.", //225
"P3: Told ya.",
"P4: Was talking about...",
"P3: Hm?",
"P4: Eh, nevermind.",
"P1: How about other priests?", //230
"P4: Wasn't she the only one in this town?",
"P3: I think so.",
"P2: Yeah, I am. Why?",
"P1: Do you mind if I try something with that?",
"P2: Don't even dare to touch it!", //235
"P2: It's blessed with good god's energy.",
"(priests house)",
"(After a long...)",
"(After a really long...)",
"(After a really tiring and long time...)", //240
"P2: Not only Infrids don't know what someone's privacy means!",
"P3: Calm down my lady.",
"P3: I didn't see anything terrifying there.",
"P4: Speak for yourself...",
"P1: I feel confused a little.", //245
"P2: How about me? What should I say then?",
"P4: Maybe something like I'm sorry you had to watch this?",
"P1: You were the one who decided to check my wardrobe.",
"P4: What a normal person hides there sha... ",
"P4: (feeling of freezing sight on yourself)", //250
"P4: Just nevermind.",
"P2: How about we go to P4 house, huh?",
"P1: Why would we?",
"P1: (feeling of freezing sight on yourself)",
"P1: Okey, feel free to do it after we resolve the mystery.", //255
"P2: Get your wardrobe ready P4.",
"P3: Maybe it's not important but I found something strange on the floor.",
"P2: Strange? It's just part of my uniform. I'm not sure why it was laying on the floor but... oh wait. ",
"P2: I have my part here so I didn't lose it. What's going on?",
"P3: If you don't need that then...", //260
"P1: She doesn't but I need it.",
"P3: Oh I didn't know you were into that type of stuff, sorry.",
"P1: ...",
"P4: Just ignore it.",
"P1: I'm trying...", //265
"P4: I know...",
"P2: I will not comment.",
"P2: Oh wait... however I will do that.",
"P2: You all...",
"P4: Don't want to hear that after seeing what you have in your wardrobe.", //270
"P2: Phew!",
"P2: Just wait until I see yours.",
"P1: Can you be serious? I'm talking to all of you now.",
"P2: I'm serious about that wardrobe.",
"P1: Just stop that.", //275
"P4: She started it.",
"P2: Like a little child. Go and cry.",
"P2: We don't need people like you here.",
"P4: And that's how she says thanks for rescuing her precious face.",
"P1: BOTH OF YOU GET OUT OF HERE!", //280
"P2: ...",
"P4: ...",
"(P2 i P4 wychodzą)",
"P1: Can you give me that?",
"P1: I want to take a closer look at this.", //285
"P3: Yeah, sure.",
"(drept P3)",
"P1: Just as I thought.",
"P1: This is a fake one...",
"P3: How did you know that?", //290
"P1: The material is different from the one she uses. ",
"P3: Don't say that you opened her wardrobe as well...",
"P1: Shhh.",
"P1: She doesn't need to know that.",
"P3: But why would someone fake a piece of her wardrobe?", //295
"P1: For the same reason as faking the original saint staff.",
"P3: Do you want to say that she has a fake one now?",
"P1: Not sure about that but there is a big chance that Infrids did that while she was taking a shower.",
"P3: But they wanted P2 and not her staff.",
"P1: Maybe they wanted us to think like that.", //300
"P1: I think that we must return to my dad’s library.",
"P1: If I am right then we'll find there something very interesting.",
"P1: (cough)",
"P2: I bet that we'll meet Infrids again guys. Does anyone want to bet?",
"P4: I didn't know you were a gambler P2.", //305
"P2: Phew.",
"P2: You know nothing about me.",
"P4: I wouldn't say the same thing after seeing what you hide inside the wardrobe...",
"P2: It's the proof that you know nothing about me P4.",
"P2: Does anyone want to bet?", //310
"P1: I would appreciate if you would take it serious P2.",
"P2: But I'm serious about that bet.",
"P1: ...",
"P4: ...",
"P2: No one understands my feelings!", //315
"P4: If you only had any...",
"P2: ...",
"P3: Calm down friends. You can't argue like that forever.",
"P2: No worries P3. I'm not arguing.",
"P2: I find facts.", //320
"P3: It's not what ...",
"P4: See? Try to talk with her and you'll understand who is the victim here.",
"P2: Victim?! ",
"P2: Let me show you the situation where you'll be the one then!",
"P4: Go ahead. I'm not scared of you and your divine powers. ", //325
"P4: You're even weaker than Infrids.",
"P2: Say what?!",
"P3: Em...",
"P3: Friends?",
"P1: I'm afraid that it must wait. We have a bigger problem here.", //330
"P2: Nothing is more important than showing this big head where is his place.",
"P3: How about bloodthirsty Infrids in front of us?",
"P2: How many times I need to repeat that Infrids aren't bloodthirsty creatures.",
"P2: They are adorable, cute and...",
"P2: WHAT IS THAT?!", //335
"P3: Your cute little Infrids my lady.",
"P3: Look. They had something with them.",
"P1: Interesting...",
"P4: Why did they have divine crystals with them?",
"P1: Divine crystals? You mean the ones that...", //340
"P2: Yeah. You can destroy the world...",
"P2: and do some other stuff with them if you are know-how.",
"P4: And who will explain to me why I am not surprised that she knows such things.",
"P2: ...",
"P2: Can I...", //345
"P3: No.",
"P1: No.",
"P2: ...",
"P2: Okey.",
"P2: We should take them and look at them closer inside the library. I need to check something if possible.", //350
"P1: And I have to find the thing that my dad mentioned in the letter.",
"P4: Let me read the whole letter then.",
"P3: And I?",
"P3: (sigh)",
"P2: I was right! They're all the same as mine inside the staff. But... how?", //355
"P2: I thought that there are only one green, one blue, and one red crystal. What's going on?",
"P2: They don't look fake and that's the problem.",
"P2: I have already tried to put them inside my staff and it worked as well. It can't be fake.",
"P3: Hello my lady. Is there anything that I can help you with?",
"P2: Oh, hi P3. I was wondering if there is a possibility to connect the crystals. I know that you were studying this subject with me not that long ago and you had a few ideas back then.", //360
"P3: But you called me a stupid idiot and that there is no way it would work...",
"P2: Ah...",
"P2: Mmmm...",
"P2: Forget about that.",
"P3: It's okay. I can try to help you to figure it out.", //365
"P4: My dear...",
"P4: I love you...",
"P4: I miss you...",
"P4: I want to see you...",
"P4: Hope to meet you tomorrow...", //370
"P4: Tomorrow? ",
"P4: ...",
"P4: I only wonder when he wrote this letter.",
"P4: I can't stop thinking about you...",
"P4: ...", //375
"P4: Sounds more like a love letter but I'm not an expert.",
"P3: Hi there.",
"P4: Hi.",
"P3: Is it only my imagination or you look confused?",
"P4: Hm...", //380
"P4: Who knows.",
"P3: Maybe you?",
"P4: ...",
"P4: I wasn't the one who wrote this, okay?",
"P3: I didn't even say that.", //385
"P4: Is it normal to miss your child so much?",
"P3: Depends on parent I think.",
"P3: Why asking?",
"P4: There is no special reason.",
"P4: Anyway there is something strange in this letter.", //390
"P3: What do you mean?",
"P4: According to what I read we should go to the most suspicious place.",
"P3: Is there anything more?",
"P4: Hm...",
"P4: (My love is eternal...)", //395
"P4: Not really.",
"P3: I see.",
"P4: What do you think about this?",
"P3: We don't know details and we can only guess. It doesn't sound good.",
"P4: You're right but three places came to my mind and I'm pretty sure it must be one of them.", //400
"P3: I like your confidence, my friend.",
"P4: This library belongs to a suspicious man. Doesn't that mean that the library is also suspicious?",
"P3: If you think about it like this, it makes logical sense. What's next?",
"P4: When Infrids came crazy they set the house on fire. It makes that place suspicious as well.",
"P3: I wouldn't think about it. Good point.", //405
"P4: The last place we can go to is the forest. I don't need to say that it's suspicious because suspicious Infrids live there, right?",
"P3: Doesn't that make it the most suspicious place of all?",
"P1: It doesn't make sense at all.",
"P1: He said that I will recognize it but it is like a wild-goose chase. ",
"P1: (sigh)", //410
"P1: I will just go and eat my late breakfast. I'm really hungry.",
"P3: Make two sandwiches at once, please.",
"P1: ???",
"P3: You were going to make breakfast so I decided to come.",
"P1: I just have no idea where I can find THAT thing.", //415
"P3: Did you look everywhere?",
"P1: Not yet. This building is really big...",
"P3: Probably not as big as P4 head.",
"P1: What?",
"P3: Nothing. I just remembered the princess's words.", //420
"P1: You don't help...",
"P3: I would help but I'm not you.",
"P1: ...",
"P3: Okay, sorry.",
"P1: Eh, just wonderful ... I spilled it.", //425
"P1: Can you hand me a broom, please?",
"P3: Yeah, sure. ",

"P3: Here you are.",
"P1: Tha... ", //430
"P1: Impossible!",
"P3: Oh come on I also happen to be nice and helpful ...",
"P1: I'm not talking about you.",
"P3: Have you never seen a broom then?",
"P1: It's not a broom. Look closer.", //435
"P3: Hmmm...",
"P3: Impossible!",
"P1: We found it P3!",
"P3: I am glad that I was useful for something.",
"P3: But I have a question. Is it fake or our lady's staff is fake?", //440
"P1: And that is a good question...",
"P3: If I remember right then Ingrids attacked our princess in the bathroom. Is there a chance that they took away the real one?",
"P1: My father wrote in the letter that a fake princess will hold the real staff. ",
"P3: It doesn't make any sense P1.",
"P1: ...", //445
"P1: I know.",
"P3: Is our princess fake? I hope not.",
"P1: And the worst part is that this staff doesn't seem to be fake...",
"I am not sure if we are ready for this.",
"P1: No one is.", //450
"P4: ...",
"P1: But we must end it.",
"P2: I don't know if our decisions were too random ...",
"P3: What decisions?",
"P1: (sigh)", //455
"P2: (sigh)",
"P4: (sigh)",
"P3: Aaa. These decisions...",
"P1: We have to believe in ourselves.",
"P4: I am confident about my decision but I am not so sure about others.", //460
"P2: (icy stare).",
"P4: We don't even know if we've forgotten something.",
"P1: Don't panic. This is the worst thing we could do now.",
"P2: Oh, then I can bet with you about meeting Infrids here?",
"P4: (icy stare).", //465
"P2: It was only a joke P4...",
"P4: I wouldn't be so sure about that...",
"P1: Am I the only one who has a bad feeling about this?",
"P3: Probably not.",
"P3: Last time after P2 attempt to make a bet, Infrids appeared.", //470
"P4: Sounds like trouble.",
"P1: I can even see that trouble.",
"P1: Hey. Can we talk about...",
"Infrids: Attack!",
"P1: Not even a chance to talk, huh?", //475
"P1: I just want to talk to them.",
"P4: We all want...",
"P2: Not really.",
"P1: ???",
"P3: ???", //480
"P4: ???",
"P2: Why should I talk with them?",
"P2: They're trying to kill us...",
"P1: Don't blame them. I am sure someone else is pulling the strings.",
"P2: This is not an explanation ...", //485
"P4: Watch out!",
"P1: Deja Vu?",
"P2: I'm feeling tired...",
"P3: Hold on my precious princess.",
"P2: But I don't want you to die...", //490
"P2: I need to keep my best or...",
"P4: Don't worry. We're all strong and tough enough to protect ourselves.",
"P2: No. I don't want to lose anyone else...",
"P3: My princess...",
"P2: I'm a high priest. I can't watch someone's else death.", //495
"P4: And you were the one who said that don't want to talk with Infrids...",
"P2: That's because I know that... they're cursed and will not listen to us...",
"P4: Cursed? What do you mean?",
"P2: I see it... ",
"P2: I can't explain it...", //500
"P1: Well, we don't have time for it as well. They're coming!",
"P2: I'm feeling...",
