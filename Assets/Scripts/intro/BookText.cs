His favourite spell is white energy ball, that he throws at enemies. Although he knows many powerful spells, he's so obsessed over white energy ball that he only uses it and basic attack. When he gets angry he uses his cane to hit people heads.",

He likes to bring destruction over distant targets with his cannons while listening to classical music. He rams his opponents with brutal force. To not remain inferior he taught himself one magic ability. ",
